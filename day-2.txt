The difference between Document and Window object

The document and window object are the object whose interfaces you generally use most often in DOM 
programming. In simple terms, the window object represents like the browser and the document object is the
root of the document itself. Elememt inherits from the generic node interface and together these two 
interfaces provide many of the methods and properties use on individual element.

Window objects:
The window object is a global object i client side javascript, representing the browser window containing a
DOM document andd acting as the root of the document object model. The window object supporting by all browser
and represent the browser's window and automatically includes global javascript objects, functions and 
variables as member. The window object is responsible for managing the global variables, functions and objects
providing methods for browser interaction and managing properties related to frames, tabs, windows such as 
alert(), confirm(), setTimeout() and setInterval().

Few Properties of Window objects are,

window.innerHeight - the inner height of the browser window(in pixels)
window.innerWidth - the inner width of the browser window(in pixels)

Few Methhodds of Window objects are,

window.open() - open a new window
window.close() - close the current window
window.moveTo() - move the current window
window.resizeTo() - resize the current window

Document objects:
The document object is the HTML document that appears in the browser window and serves as an interface
for interacting with the web pages content.The browser generates a document object model of a web page 
upon loading it.

The DOM manipulating tool offer methods to access and manipulate the structure and content of a document
such  as getElementById(),querySelector(), createElement() and innerHTML. It represents the entire HTML
document as a node tree, with the document object as the root node. It allow dynamic updates and interactions
with the web page content.

Few Properties of Document objects are,

element.innerHTML - new HTML content or change the inner html of a element
element.attributes - new value or change the attributes value of an element

Few Methods of Document object are,

document.createElement(element) - create a HTML document
ddocument.removeChild(element) - remove a HTML document

In conclusion of the difference between document and window object is crucial in javascript and web
development. Windows manage the browser interactions while document acts as an interface for content
manipulation. Using these functionalities allows developers to create interactives web experiences.
